                            on in the bowels of the Raccoon City Hospital. During the experiments, she was deliberately
                            infected with the t-virus, and something unexpected happened. Alice's DNA bonded with the
                            virus on a cellular level, adapting to it and changing it. Resulting in her strength and
                            speed being increased. With Alice's DNA bonding and also escaping from Umbrella, Alice had
                            to stay low. Umbrella already had her blood samples and were trying to clone her and always
                            resulted badly.
